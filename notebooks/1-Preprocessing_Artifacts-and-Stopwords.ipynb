Then we will compare the text with a stronger list of stopwords (source). We will see which words are both in the text and the stronger stopwords list. We will inspect these lists manually and extract a list of protected words. We will iterate over this process a number of times. Once we have a robust list of protected words, we will concatenate NLTK's stopwords list with the stronger one and eliminate the protected words from it. This will provide a final (hopefully middle ground) stopword list with which to continue."
